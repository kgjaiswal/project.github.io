<p>&emsp;HIV is the virus, which attacks the T-cells (CD-4 cells) in the immune system. AIDS is the syndrome, which appears in the advanced stage of HIV infection.
AIDS is a medical condition. HIV infection can cause AIDS to develop. However, it is possible to be infected with HIV without developing AIDS. Without treatment, the HIV infection can progress and, eventually, it will develop into AIDS in the vast majority of cases. Once someone has received an AIDS diagnosis, it will always carry over with them in their medical history.</p>

<p><b><h3>What are the causes of HIV/AIDS?</h3></b></p>
<p>HIV is a retrovirus that infects the vital organs and cells of the human immune system.
The virus progresses in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) - a drug therapy that slows or prevents the growth of new HIV viruses.<br>
The rate of virus progression varies between individuals and depends on many factors;<br>
These factors include the age of the patient, the body's ability to defend against HIV, access to healthcare, existence of other infections, the infected person's genetic inheritance, resistance to certain strains of HIV, and more.</p>
<p><b><h3>How is HIV transmitted?</h3></b></p>
<p><b>Sexual transmission</b> - It can happen when there is contact with infected sexual fluids (rectal, genital, or oral mucous membranes). This can happen while having unprotected sex, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex, or sharing sex toys with someone infected with HIV.</p>
<p><b>Perinatal transmission</b> - A mother can pass the infection on to her child during childbirth, pregnancy, and also through breastfeeding.</p>
<p><b>Blood transmission</b> - The risk of transmitting HIV through blood transfusion is nowadays extremely low in developed countries. However, among injection or IV drug users, sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood is extremely hazardous.</p>
<p><b><h3>What are the symptoms AIDS?</h3></b></p>
Many people with HIV have no symptoms for several months to even years after becoming infected. Others may develop symptoms similar to flu, usually 2-6 weeks after catching the virus.
During late-stage HIV infection, the risk of developing a life-threatening illness is much greater. <br>
Symptoms of late-stage HIV infection may include:<br>
<ul><li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Diarrhea, which is usually persistent or chronic</li>
<li>Dry cough</li>
<li>Fever of above 100 °F (37 °C) lasting for weeks</li>
<li>Night sweats</li>
<li>Permanent tiredness</li>
<li>Shortness of breath (dyspnea)</li>
<li>Swollen glands lasting for weeks</li>
<li>Unintentional weight loss</li>
<li>White spots on the tongue or mouth</li></ul>
<p><b><h3>What are the Precautions and treatments for AIDS?</h3></b></p>
<ol type="i"><li>The red ribbon is the worldwide symbol of support and awareness for people living with HIV.</li>
<li>There is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS. Treatments can slow the course of the condition - and allow most infected people the opportunity to live a long and relatively healthy life.</li>
<li>Earlier HIV antiretroviral treatment is crucial - it improves quality of life, extends life expectancy, and reduces the risk of transmission, according to the World Health Organization's guidelines issued in June 2013.</li>
<li>Currently, there is no vaccine or cure for HIV, but treatments have evolved which are much more effective and better tolerated - they can improve patients' general health and quality of life considerably, in as little as one pill per day.</li>
